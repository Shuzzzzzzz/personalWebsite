This personal website project is a comprehensive representation of my professional identity, built with a stack comprising HTML, CSS, JavaScript, sql and PHP. The website serves as an interactive platform, featuring a user-friendly interface to explore my skills, education, and projects. A contact form is integrated, allowing visitors to submit messages and contact information securely. The admin login provides an exclusive space for managing and reviewing these submissions.
